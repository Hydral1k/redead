The skin VMTs are arranged into 4 main groups, each of which by default direct back to the original skins. By editing these VMTs and giving them a new path, you can add custom skins. The groups are:

Group 1:
  01
  02
  03
  04
  05

Group 2:
  01
  02
  03
  04
  05

Group 3:
  01
  02
  03
  04
  05

Group 4:
  01
  02
  03
  04
  05

Citizen Sheets:
  Citizen_Sheet
  Citizen2_Sheet
  Citizen3_Sheet

Group 1 and the original Citizen_Sheet should generally not be modified so as to keep the original skins, but of course I won't force anything on you. Skin as you like. If you're only going to add in one group's worth of skins, I suggest making two of the groups direct to it. This will balance it out so the originals and new skins appear equally. Mention that to people if you distribute it, though.
